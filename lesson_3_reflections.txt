When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	Working with other team developers, sharing with a community

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	To have more control

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	forks - clone repository in github, maintain links to original repository
	clones - copy a repository from github to local (or local to local)
	branches - create a new line of code from a repository


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	To ensure that we work on the last version shared with others.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	Harder!

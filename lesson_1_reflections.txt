What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You can ensure that commits are related to a single logical change, and that the versions committed are executable

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because, very often, the changes to a functionality in code require changes in more than one file

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log - to list the different commits and description of changes
    git diff - to compare the changes between 2 commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because it is easy to step back to previous working versions
